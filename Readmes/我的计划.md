# ♿ Hackathon Idea Summary: Inclusive Assistive App + IoT Ecosystem

## 🧠 Focus Area:
**Assistive Technology** · **IoT for Accessibility** · **Community Integration** · **Caregiver Support** · **Digital Mapping for Disability Access**

---

## 💡 Problem Overview
Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients face many recurring "minor" but critical challenges after returning home from hospital, including:

- Timely **health management** (e.g., urinary schedule, skin pressure check)
- Risk of **accidents during transfer** (e.g., bed, wheelchair, toilet)
- **Home environment inaccessibility** (narrow doors, high counters, unreachable shelves)
- Lack of **caregiver availability**
- Severe **social isolation**
- Lack of **real-time location and accessibility data**

---

## 📱 App + IoT Solution Summary

### 1. Health Management Without Burden
- Family and volunteers should **receive pre-programmed schedules** for:
  - Urination reminders
  - Skin pressure sore inspections
  - Other common SCI complications
- Implement **algorithm-based smart reminders** for family/caregivers based on patient schedule (so patient doesn’t have to ask).
- Push proactive notices:  
  _“It’s been 4 hours, time to check in on ___ for pressure sores”_

> ✅ Reduces patient anxiety of “having to ask”

---

### 2. Emergency Assist Button System (IoT)
- Install **multi-height physical buttons** beside bed, toilet, and shower (affordable IoT switch modules like ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Zero)
- Link to app to **trigger emergency or non-urgent requests**
- System logs button use to help analyze fall/transfer risk

---

### 3. Home Accessibility Improvement Guide
- App should include **home environment checklists** (e.g., width > 36in, reachable sink, etc.)
- Integrate with local **contractors** who are experienced with accessibility retrofits (listed by rating)

---

### 4. Volunteer Pool for Low-Privacy Assistance
- App includes **volunteer recruitment + vetting** system
- Volunteers can provide:
  - Companionship
  - Meal prep
  - Housekeeping
  - Errands
- No need for intimate physical assistance (preserves patient dignity and volunteer safety)

---

### 5. Community + Social Points
- Community board where users post **daily stories, photos, check-ins**
- Posting = earns **community points**
- Points can be exchanged for:
  - Equipment
  - Services
  - Local business discounts
  - Volunteer hours from the platform

---

### 6. Google Maps + Route Feedback
- Integrate **Google Maps API** for accessible routing
- Add ability to:
  - **Pin and rate** wheelchair-friendly/unfriendly spots
  - Use thumbs-up/thumbs-down system to **flag poorly designed facilities**
  - Crowdsource **real accessibility data**

---

### 7. Real-Time Family & Emergency View
- Family can view **real-time patient location** (if enabled by user)
- See recent:
  - Button press events
  - Route choices
  - Any community posts or check-ins

---

## 🚀 Hackathon Team Focus
We are interested in exploring how **assistive apps** combined with **low-cost IoT** and **community integration** can make independent living more feasible and dignified for people with spinal cord injuries and other mobility impairments.

---

## 📝 Answer for “What area/focus are you interested in?”
> We’re interested in Assistive Technology for mobility-impaired individuals, combining app-based care coordination, low-cost IoT emergency buttons, and a social mapping system for accessible environments. We aim to empower both patients and caregivers with tools for communication, health management, and community support.
